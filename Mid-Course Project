- medium: 20.00 - 24.99
- high: 25.00 - 29.99
Question: How many films have a replacement cost in the "low" group?

A:
SELECT 
CASE
WHEN replacement_cost >=9.99 AND replacement_cost <=19.99 THEN 'low'
WHEN replacement_cost >=20 AND replacement_cost <=24.99 THEN 'medium'
WHEN replacement_cost >=25 AND replacement_cost <=29.99 THEN 'high'
END AS rp_category,
COUNT(*) AS no_of_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rp_category
ORDER BY no_of_films

3. Task: Create a list of the film titles including their title, length, and category name ordered descendingly by length.
Filter the results to only the movies in the category 'Drama' or 'Sports'.
Question: In which category is the longest film and how long is it?

A:
SELECT title, length, name AS category FROM film f
INNER JOIN film_category fc ON
f.film_id=fc.film_id
INNER JOIN category c ON
fc.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE name IN('Drama', 'Sports')
ORDER BY length DESC

4. Task: Create an overview of how many movies (titles) there are in each category (name).
